/// V1beta1PolicyRulesWithSubjects : PolicyRulesWithSubjects prescribes a test that applies to a request to an apiserver. The test considers the subject making the request, the verb being requested, and the resource to be acted upon. This PolicyRulesWithSubjects matches a request if and only if both (a) at least one member of subjects matches the request and (b) at least one member of resourceRules or nonResourceRules matches the request.
